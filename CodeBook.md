## The 'CodeBook' for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

According to the course instructions I should submit a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md(this file).

# The submitted CodeBook.md is a decription of the data set
